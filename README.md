NGINX as root-Webserver

Sub-folder django redirects to localhost:8000

All control of docker is done by "Makefile". Perhaps I will change later to docker-compose.
But so far I don't need it, because my dockers run all stand-alone.
The moment I want to connect to other services by individual dockers I will rethink it.
